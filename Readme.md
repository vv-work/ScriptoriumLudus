The name "Scriptorium Ludus" has its roots in Latin:

- **Scriptorium**: A Latin term, 'Scriptorium' refers to a place for writing. In historical contexts, it was often used to describe a room in monasteries where monks would copy, write, and illuminate manuscripts. In the context of this project, it represents a place for creating, developing, and maintaining code.

- **Ludus**: 'Ludus' is a Latin word with multiple meanings, including game, play, and school. In the context of this project, 'Ludus' represents the playful and educational aspects of coding and technology, emphasizing that learning and growth can occur through play and exploration.

## Project Description

Scriptorium Ludus is a repository dedicated to the exploration and documentation of various topics in technology, emphasizing the fun and educational aspects of learning. It serves as a collection of notes, resources, and guides, acting as a digital 'Scriptorium' where knowledge in the form of code and tech-related content is created and stored.

This project is designed to be a source of knowledge and a tool for learning, embodying the spirit of a 'Ludus', a place of play and education. Through Scriptorium Ludus, we embrace the philosophy that learning is a playful, engaging, and continuous journey.
